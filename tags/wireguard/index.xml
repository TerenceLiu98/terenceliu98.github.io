      <description>Before In the previous project: Homelab, I listed all my devices and VPS on a table, where all the VPS own a specific public IP, and I tried to use the Wireguard to connect them into a Full-mesh intranet.
However, to investigate deeper into the network performance, I started to learn how to federate these clusters while not affecting the current usage. What&amp;rsquo;s more, if I can federate this isolated network, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to build separate services in different clusters.</description>

      <description>Before K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes which is more suitable for the Edge/IoT/CI/ARM scenario/devices. Usually, for person, we do not have multiple high-performance device like 24c server or even higher. Hence, K3s is a way we can learn how to set up a kubernetes cluster.
For me, I am a bare metal fanatic many year ago, but I changed into a Docker user after I know more about virtualization and containers.</description>
