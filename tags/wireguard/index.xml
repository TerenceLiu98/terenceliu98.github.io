      <description>Before In the previous project: Homelab, I listed all my devices and VPS on a table, where all the VPS own a specific public IP, and I tried to use the Wireguard to connect them into a Full-mesh intranet.
However, to investigate deeper into the network performance, I started to learn how to federate these clusters while not affecting the current usage. What&amp;rsquo;s more, if I can federate this isolated network, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to build separate services in different clusters.</description>

      <description>Before K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes which is more suitable for the Edge/IoT/CI/ARM scenario/devices. Usually, for person, we do not have multiple high-performance device like 24c server or even higher. Hence, K3s is a way we can learn how to set up a kubernetes cluster.
For me, I am a bare metal fanatic many year ago, but I changed into a Docker user after I know more about virtualization and containers.</description>

      <description>In General Tools I use I choose Wireguard since it‚Äôs fast because of its light design, and it‚Äôs secure because it uses the best cryptographic tools available. However, for each time, the user may need to consider a SUBNET for the wireguard and a IP for each node, for me, it is every annoyed, as I have too many subnet need to be configured. Thus, I build a little tool: wgtools</description>
