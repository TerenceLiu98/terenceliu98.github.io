      <description>As I have mentioned in K3s Setup 2, usually, it is not easy for the China&amp;rsquo;s user to access https://gcr.io, https://k8s.gcr.io or https://ghcr.io. Thus, under this circumstance, we may set up a server as the registry proxy endpoint.
Some options DockerHub provide a &amp;ldquo;offical&amp;rdquo; package called Docker Registry where it is a stateless, hightly scalable server side application that stores and lets users distribute Docker images.
Nexus Repository OSS, provided by Sonatype, is an open source repository that supports many artifact formats, including Docker, Java™, and npm.</description>

      <title>Homelab: Don&#39;t Let the Docker escape from the ufw&#39;s control</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Uncomplicated firewall&amp;rdquo;, a.k.a, UFW, is the new/next-generation of firewall of Linux system. As says in its name, &amp;ldquo;uncomplicated&amp;rdquo; is the feature. However, in some situation, it is still complicated, for example, works with Docker.
Usually, for the homelab/VPS, we self-host a bunch of services and use them with reverse proxy (like Nginx, Caddy, Traefik) with different subdomain. However, Docker tries to modify the firewall rules without notification, like this:
ubuntu@myserver:~$ sudo ufw status Status: active To Action From -- ------ ---- 80 ALLOW Anywhere 443 ALLOW Anywhere 22 ALLOW Anywhere 80 (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) 443 (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) 22 (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) In ufw list, I only allow the SSH port and HTTP/HTTPS ports.</description>
