      <title>👨‍💻 My Personal Experimental Network: L-Net 1.2</title>

      <description>Before In the previous project: Homelab, I upgraded my configuration on the L-Net, where I tried eBGP and iBGP for the routing exchange between different subnet.
However, since, there are too many interface in the backbone device. In this post, I tried to build a overlay network with VXLAN over Wireguard.
VXLAN  VXLAN, Virtual eXtensible LAN is a network virtualization technology that attempts to address the scalability problems associated with large cloud computing deployments.</description>

      <title>👨‍💻 My Personal Experimental Network: L-Net 1.1</title>

      <description>Before In the previous project: Homelab, I create a experimental network and I call it L-Net 1.0. However, I am trying to redesign the network as I am trying to maximize the usage of all the bandwidth, route auto-correction, and manage the resources based on one machine outside the cluster. Here is the diagram:
Here, as usual, I made three network areas, “East-Asia-CN” is 192.168.101.0/24 , “Southeast-Asia-HKSAR“ is 192.168.102.0/24, and “East-Aisa-JP“ is 192.</description>

      <description>Before In the previous project: Homelab, I listed all my devices and VPS on a table, where all the VPS own a specific public IP, and I tried to use the Wireguard to connect them into a Full-mesh intranet.
However, to investigate deeper into the network performance, I started to learn how to federate these clusters while not affecting the current usage. What&amp;rsquo;s more, if I can federate this isolated network, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to build separate services in different clusters.</description>
