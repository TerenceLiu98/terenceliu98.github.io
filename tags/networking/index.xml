      <description>Networking For the homelab, I would like to choose a commerical company&amp;rsquo;s product, as the service can be guaranteed by the company reputation. All my devices can connect to the WAN via NAT1 such that I don&amp;rsquo;t need the nat passthrough solution. I choose Tailscale as I mentioned, it performs well under my testing. Just follow the instruction and the networking problem is solved.
Service For the homelab, I would like to docker as it is very covinence and can set up easily.</description>

Thus, I build a little tool: wgtools</description>

      <description>For a long time, I held many different digital gadgets, however, I did not consider putting them into a cluster, or more precisely, setting up a platform where I can easily manage them. In this summer vacation, I started thinking of a possibility of setting up a distributed homelab.
Why Distributed Since I am wandering around the big bay area, multiple different devices are scattered. Thus, I have to build a distributed cluster.</description>
