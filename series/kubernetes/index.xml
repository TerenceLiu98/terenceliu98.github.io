      <description>Why we need a High availability Kubernetes? In production-ready environment, a system hang is not affordable. The Kubernetes can help us handling the containers&amp;rsquo; replica or the pod/service rescheduling. However, If there is only one control node, this may cause a big problem. Thus, when we talking about K8s&amp;rsquo;s HA, usually, we are talking on the control plane&amp;rsquo;s HA. I am not saying that the worker node are not important, or do not need HA, but, more importantly, is the control nodes&amp;rsquo; safety.</description>

      <description>Before What is Kuberntes Kubernetes, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Usually, we call it K8s as there are 8 characters between K and s :).&#xA;Basically, all the application are containerized, and we can easily the reason why we use K8s is that the use of microservices increasing, away from traditional monolithic-type applications. As a result, containers provide the perfeet host form these individual microservices as containers manage dependencies, are indipendent, OS-agnostic and ephemaral, amongst other benefits, which is very powerful and suitable for users as we want users to run their application isolated and donot be influenced by others.</description>

      <title>🧑🏿‍💻 K3s/Kubernetes - Set up a K3s Cluster with your VPS (Extra Story 1)</title>

      <description>As I have mentioned in K3s Setup 2, usually, it is not easy for the China&amp;rsquo;s user to access https://gcr.io, https://k8s.gcr.io or https://ghcr.io. Thus, under this circumstance, we may set up a server as the registry proxy endpoint.&#xA;Some options DockerHub provide a &amp;ldquo;offical&amp;rdquo; package called Docker Registry where it is a stateless, hightly scalable server side application that stores and lets users distribute Docker images.&#xA;Nexus Repository OSS, provided by Sonatype, is an open source repository that supports many artifact formats, including Docker, Java™, and npm.</description>

      <description>Generating a basic K3s cluster is quite easy by following the K3s&amp;rsquo;s Doc. let try to modify it into High Availability Cluster. Single server cluster can meet a variety of use cases, but for environments where uptime of the Kubenetes control plane is critical, where we need the High Availability configuration. There are two ways for High Availability:&#xA;High Availability with an External DB (for example, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB) High Availability with Embedded DB (etcd) I chose the second one - with Embedded DB.</description>

      <description>Before K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes which is more suitable for the Edge/IoT/CI/ARM scenario/devices. Usually, for person, we do not have multiple high-performance device like 24c server or even higher. Hence, K3s is a way we can learn how to set up a kubernetes cluster.&#xA;For me, I am a bare metal fanatic many year ago, but I changed into a Docker user after I know more about virtualization and containers.</description>
